# 🎵 Music Store Data Analysis (SQL Project)

This project uses SQL to explore a fictional music store database and answer key business questions related to customer behaviour, sales trends, and artist performance.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- SQL
- PostgreSQL 
- DBeaver 

## 📌 Objective
To practice and demonstrate SQL skills by performing data analysis on a normalized relational database. The goal was to extract meaningful insights about customers, invoices, artists, and music genres.

## 🔍 Key Questions & Insights

- Who is the senior-most employee?
- Which countries generate the most invoices?
- Top 3 highest invoice totals
- Which city brings in the most revenue (best customers)?
- Who is the best customer based on money spent?
- Who listens to Rock music (emails & names)?
- Top 10 Rock artists with the most tracks
- Tracks longer than the average song duration
- How much did each customer spend on each artist?

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- SQL Joins (INNER JOIN, etc.)
- Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- Subqueries
- ORDER BY, GROUP BY, DISTINCT
- String concatenation
- Filtering using WHERE and HAVING

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repo.
2. Load the SQL file into your SQL environment (PostgreSQL / SQLite / MySQL).
3. Connect to the sample music store database (provided externally).
4. Run each query section-wise to explore results.
